    "question": "What is an abstract?",

    "question": "What if my research doesn't fit the theme?",
    "answer": "It's okay if your research doesn't perfectly fit the theme. You can think creatively about how your research might relate to it. For example, how could future research incorporate the conference theme to answer important cross-cultural research questions?",

    "question": "Do I have to give an oral presentation?",
    "answer": "Not necessarily. When you submit your abstract, you'll be asked if you prefer to give an oral or poster presentation. Poster presentations require you to design and print an A0-sized poster. During the conference, you'll stand by your poster to answer questions and chat about your research.",

    "question": "I want to present but I really dislike public speaking",

    "question": "What counts as undergraduate research?",
    "answer": "Any original work you've done during your undergraduate degree counts. This could include a class project, literature review, honours thesis, internship research, or supervised research. It doesn't need to be published or high-impact to be valuable!",

    "question": "What if I get asked questions I don't know how to answer?",
    "answer": "You're not expected to know everything. It's okay to say you'll need to think about it more or look into it further. You can also invite the questioner to share their thoughts. Some of the best conversations come from unexpected questions!",

    "id": 20,
    "question": "Is there a registration fee?",
    "answer": "Information about registration fees are now available on the ACUR website. As some universities may offer to cover or subsidise a portion of the fee for student presenters, it is a good idea to ask your faculty or student services about this.",
