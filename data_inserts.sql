INSERT INTO `faqs` VALUES (1,'How do I reset my password?','Go to Account → Security → Reset Password, then follow the email link.','{\"topic\": \"account\"}','2025-09-13 05:17:49'),(2,'Do you offer student discounts?','Yes — students get 20% off with a valid ID or .edu email.','{\"topic\": \"billing\"}','2025-09-13 05:17:49'),(4,'What is an abstract?','An abstract is a short summary of your research project. It outlines your research question, methods, and key findings or expected outcomes. Think of it as a snapshot that helps reviewers and attendees understand what your project is about. For more abstract guidelines, click here.','[\"abstract\",\"research\",\"short summary\",\"project\"]','2025-09-30 11:03:35'),(5,'What if my research doesn’t fit the theme?','It’s okay if your research doesn’t perfectly fit the theme. You can think creatively about how your research might relate to it. For example, how could future research incorporate the conference theme to answer important cross-cultural research questions?','[\"research topic\",\"theme\",\"conference theme\"]','2025-09-30 11:05:26'),(6,'Do I have to give an oral presentation?','Not necessarily. When you submit your abstract, you’ll be asked if you prefer to give an oral or poster presentation. Poster presentations require you to design and print an A0-sized poster.

','[\"good research\",\"peer review\",\"conference\"]','2025-09-30 11:07:37'),(9,'Who review the abstracts?','Abstracts are reviewed by academics and professionals involved in undergraduate research. They consider clarity, originality, relevance, and how effectively the research is communicated.','[\"abstract\",\"review abstract\",\"undergraduate research\"]','2025-09-30 11:08:11'),(10,'What counts as undergraduate research?','Any original work you’ve done during your undergraduate degree counts. This could include a class project, literature review, honours thesis, internship research, or supervised research. It doesn’t need to be published or high-impact to be valuable!','[\"undergraduate research\",\"undergraduate degree counts\"]','2025-09-30 11:08:47'),(11,'What is I get asked questions I don’t know how to answer?','You’re not expected to know everything. It’s okay to say you’ll need to think about it more or look into it further. You can also invite the questioner to share their thoughts. Some of the best conversations come from unexpected questions!','[\"knowledge\",\"know\",\"questioner\",\"question\",\"unexpected questions\"]','2025-09-30 11:09:34'),(12,'My research isn’t finished yet. Can I still present?','Yes. You can present research that’s in progress.

ACUR welcomes all attendees, whether you’re presenting or just keen to learn and network. It’s a great chance to see what research other students are doing and get inspired.','[\"attendee\",\"presentation\",\"networking\"]','2025-09-30 11:13:00'),(14,'Do I have to be part of a university research program to submit?','Not necessarily. As long as you’re an undergraduate student or recently completed your degree, you’re eligible to submit, even if the research was done independently or as part of a course assignment or capstone.','[\"capstone\",\"university research\",\"undergraduate student\"]','2025-09-30 11:15:41'),(15,'Can I submit group research?','Yes! Group submissions are welcome. You can choose to present as a team or nominate one group member to present on behalf of everyone. Just make sure everyone involved is acknowledged.','[\"group research\",\"group submissions\",\"team\",\"behalf\"]','2025-09-30 11:16:30'),(16,'I’m in my first year. Can I still apply?','Yes! While many students present honours or capstone projects, first- and second-year students are very welcome to submit. If you’ve done a class project, literature review, or early-stage research, you can still share your ideas.','[\"first year\",\"project\",\"submit\",\"early-stage research\"]','2025-09-30 11:17:22'),(17,'When should I start preparing my submission?','As soon as possible! Even if the submission portal isn’t open yet, you can start by drafting your abstract, organising your findings, and checking in with your supervisor or lecturer for support.','[\"prepare\",\"when\",\"submission portal\"]','2025-09-30 11:17:54'),(18,'Which country do I have to be from to be eligible to submit?','ACUR is open to all undergraduate students studying at a university or higher education institution in the Australasian region.

You do not need to dress formally. Just aim for something neat, tidy, and comfortable. If you are presenting, choose an outfit that helps you feel confident and professional.','[\"dress code\",\"wear\",\"clothing\"]','2025-09-30 11:18:54'),(20,'Is there a registration fee?','Information about registration fees are now available on the ACUR website. As some universities may offer to cover or subsidise a portion of the fee for student presenters, it is a good idea to ask your faculty or student services about this. ','[\"fee\",\"registration fee\",\"cost\"]','2025-09-30 11:19:40'),(21,'Will my travel or accommodation be covered?','Students are usually responsible for their own travel and accommodation. However, your university may offer funding or small grants to support conference participation. Ask your supervisor or honours coordinator if any assistance is available.','[\"travel\",\"cost\",\"budget\",\"accommodation\",\"fund\",\"cover\"]','2025-09-30 11:20:18'),(22,'What should I bring to the conference?','If you are presenting, bring your poster or a copy of your slides, plus a USB backup just in case. It’s also helpful to have a notebook and pen for notes, and a reusable water bottle.','[\"bring\",\"preparation\",\"prepare\"]','2025-09-30 11:20:44');
